For students, the system provides an easy way to submit room repair requests 24/7 via system without 
having to visit housing/college offices. The request status tracking ensures students are informed of 
when issues will be fixed.

For college housing administrators, the system generates aggregated data on repair trends to help 
uncover systemic issues and improve preventative maintenance. It also provides performance metrics 
for maintenance staff like response times and completion rate. Integrations with college 
directory/authentication systems allow seamless access for students using their existing credentials. 
Tie-ins with maintenance scheduling and inventory systems allow fault trends, parts requirements, 
and task urgency to automatically optimize technician work orders and parts procurement. 


The Residential College Fault Tracking System aims to improve student satisfaction by responding 
faster to room issues. For housing facilities staff, it optimizes workflows and provides data insights to 
enhance overall service quality.
